# Group 7's Audio-Based Rainfall Intensity Prediction - Deep Learning Project

This deep learning project, developed by Group 7, focuses on predicting rainfall intensity from audio data. It features three distinct models - CNN, LSTM, and ResNet - each implemented in its own dedicated directory. The project demonstrates diverse approaches in utilizing deep learning techniques for audio-based prediction tasks.

## Repository Structure

- `/cnn`: Contains the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model with scripts for processing audio data and predicting rainfall intensity.
- `/lstm`: Hosts the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) model, including scripts for data handling, feature extraction, training, and evaluation.
- `/resnet`: Features the Residual Network (ResNet) model and utilities for audio preprocessing, Mel-spectrogram generation, and model training.

## Models Overview

### CNN
The CNN directory houses a model leveraging convolutional neural networks for feature extraction from audio data, aimed at predicting rainfall intensity.

### LSTM
Within the LSTM directory, the model uses Long Short-Term Memory networks to analyze sequential audio data, capturing temporal dependencies crucial for accurate predictions.

### ResNet
The ResNet directory includes a model that applies residual learning for training deeper networks, processing Mel-spectrograms derived from audio data for intensity prediction.

## Usage

For detailed setup, installation, and execution instructions, refer to the `README.md` file in each model's directory (`/cnn`, `/lstm`, `/resnet`).
